**Breast Cancer Prediction **                                                           

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. It uses machine learning algorithms to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on various features.

**Project Overview**

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for improving treatment outcomes. This project leverages machine learning models to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on patient data.

**Features of the Project:**

**Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data splitting.

**Model Building**: Multiple machine learning classifiers were explored, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

**Model Evaluation**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to evaluate model performance.

**Model Saving**: The best-performing model was saved using Pickle for future use in the Streamlit application.

**Web App**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit allows users to input data and predict the type of tumor.
